#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 
I used SQLite and the database BIT_DB.

--How many orders were placed in January?--
SELECT COUNT(orderID)AS Orders_placed_Jan
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?--
SELECT COUNT(orderID)AS iPhone_Orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.--
SELECT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id=FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?--
SELECT 
DISTINCT product,
price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in Januaray?--
SELECT 
SUM(quantity)*price AS Total_Rev,
product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?--
SELECT
SUM(quantity),
product,
SUM(quantity)*price AS Total_Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in Febuary, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?--
SELECT
COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum),
AVG(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
ON cust.order_id=Feb.OrderID
WHERE Feb.quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
