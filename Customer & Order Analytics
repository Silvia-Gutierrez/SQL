#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 
I used SQLite Studio and the database BIT_DB.

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?--
SELECT COUNT(orderID)AS iPhone_Orders

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.--

SELECT 
SUM(quantity)*price AS Total_Rev,

--How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in Febuary, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?--
SELECT
